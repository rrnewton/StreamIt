RESULTS

----------------------------------------------------------------------
fmradio
	- works everywhere
	- have naive & optimized graphs for 16 tiles
	- have some numbers
----------------------------------------------------------------------
fft
	- have blood graph naive 64-way on 64 tiles
	- fused version (into 15 tiles) runs on uniprocessor
	- fused version looks like it deadlocks on raw
----------------------------------------------------------------------
pcademo
	- works in library
	- runs out of memory on uniprocessor
	- null ptr going through raw
----------------------------------------------------------------------
gsm
	- don't know how to split the rate-limiting filter, 
	ShortTermSynthFilter

	- had the naive version running on RAW, and it took a very
	long time to output an item, and after that only one filter
	seemed to be making progress (but progress was being made).
	The simulator crashed before I could grab the blood graph.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
perftest4
	- are we including this in asplos?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
mp3
	- needs sample I/O files to run
	- compiles on a uniprocessor
	- haven't tried pushing through RAW
	- no numbers
----------------------------------------------------------------------
crc
	- goes through library correctly
----------------------------------------------------------------------
matmul?
	- not written yet
