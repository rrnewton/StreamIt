---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's a list of things TODO:

- caption and layout figures in partition.tex

- fix the key in the blocking diag

- double-check beamform results and describe them throughout paper

	-> do the speedups make sense?  what's relation between mflop
		improvement and output improvement?
	-> fix saman's graphs!

--------------
probably not doing:

? make layout figures and describe them

? fix the structures figure to look like the others

? make sure the input.pop/peek and output.push vs. pop/peek/push is
consistent

--------------

for SAMAN:

- fix the first sentence with something that assumes the right level
of knowledge

HERE'S AN ABANDONED PARAGRAPH FROM THE OLD ABSTRACT

In this paper, we formulate the techniques that are fundamental to
such an implementation, and we demonstrate their effectiveness in
compiling the StreamIt language to the Raw processor.  Our compiler
contains three stages: 1) partitioning, which adjusts the granularity
of a stream graph to match that of a given target, 2) layout, which
maps a partitioned stream graph to a given network topology, and 3)
scheduling, which generates a fine-grained static communication
pattern for each computational element.  Our results show that we can
obtain good performance on varying granularities of Raw, even though
StreamIt is a high-level stream language without any notion of the
target topology or granularity.  We believe that our compiler
technology provides the basis for a portable programming model for
communication-exposed architectures.

#1 - These machines are especially well-suited for streaming
	applications that have regular communication patterns and
	widespread parallelism.

HERE ARE SOME RANDOM NOTES, POSSIBLY USEFUL FOR THE INTRO

- as wire delay comes to dominate the performance of architectures, a
	number of machines have software-exposed communication between
	replicated processing units (imagine, raw, trips, grid,
	smartmemories).  

These processors have replicated processing units, and are
especially good for regular streaming applications.

For these architectures to gain wide-scale acceptance, there needs to
be a high-level portable language that can be efficiently compiled to
differing targets and differing granularities.

- we present streamit as the language, and demonstrate a compiler that
	maps to differing granularities of the Raw architecture, which
	is a scalable tiled architecture.  

StreamIt presents the computation as a set of communicating filters in
a hierarchical stream graph.

- streamit as language we've developed for exposing parallelism and
	communication, especially good for static stream programs

	streamit is high-level language and should be independent of
	any architecture.  the language expresses a computation that
	can be mapped to any number of communication-exposed architctures.

- suite of fission/fusion transformations to adjust the granularity of
	a stream graph to match the granularity of a target, and for
	load balancing between different components of the architecture.

- this load balancing is especially important in streaming
	computations since the overall throughput depends on the
	slowest stage; the program is only as fast as its weakest link

- then, a layout generator that maps the layout to an architecture,
	avoiding deadlock.

- then, a communication scheduler that schedules the network inteface
	between the computational elements.  relies on a simulation of
	the execution of the graph in order to know how to schedule
	the communication code.

- results - show we can effectively utilize parallel computation
	resources on the Raw architecture for a different application
	granularities and architecture granularities
