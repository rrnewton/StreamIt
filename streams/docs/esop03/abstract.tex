We present a translation scheme that allows a broad class of dataflow
graphs to be considered under the optimization framework of the
polyhedral model.  The input to our analysis is a Phased Computation
Graph, which we define as a generalization of the most widely used DSP
representations, including synchronous dataflow, cyclo-static
dataflow, and computation graphs.  The output of our analysis is a
System of Affine Recurrence Equations (SARE) that exactly captures the
data dependences between the nodes of the original graph.

Using the SARE representation, one can apply many techniques from the
systolic and scientific communities that are new to the DSP domain.
For example, we propose simple optimizations such as node splitting,
decimation propagation, and steady-state invariant code motion that
leverage the fine-grained dependence information of the SARE to
perform novel transformations on a stream graph.  We also propose ways
in which the polyhedral model can offer new approaches to classic
problems of the DSP community, such as minimizing buffer size, code
size, and optimizing the schedule.
