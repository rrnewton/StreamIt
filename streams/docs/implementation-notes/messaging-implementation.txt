StreaMIT Compiler Flow
======================

1. Kopi scanner/parser reads in source file
2. Kopi internal translation to associate objects with objects, rather
   than names
3. Kopi to StreaMIT high IR converter
4. (High IR optimization)
5. StreaMIT high IR to low IR converter
6. StreaMIT low IR to C converter
7. (Back-end)
8. Link against run-time system

A lot of the hard work happens in (5), which reduces everything from
high IR constructs to function calls.

The run-time system has two components: a fast system, which tries to
shuffle data around as fast as it can but doesn't have good messaging
semantics, and a slow system with precise messaging semantics.  The
assumption is that messages are infrequent, so the compiler (in 5)
combines blocks such that less time is spent in the scheduler and
run-time system.

(This isn't actually quite true.  The "slow system" is actually just
the scheduler calling into finer-grained blocks, such that it can
dispatch to one block, send a message, and then call another block,
rather than running a combination block that does the subblocks
without interruption.)


Fast and Slow State
-------------------

Bottom-level filters will often have a small amount of persistent
state, such as the frequency for an audio filter.  It is possible for
the compiler to try to optimize the fast-path code through a larger
filter, using a different representation of that state to try to
perform faster calculations (for example, instead of doing four
separate multiplies inside a four-way split/join, using a single
four-way SIMD multiply).

The problem here is transferring state between faster and slower
systems.  There should be a canonical representation of data, perhaps
even in the form indicated in the source code.  A larger problem is
tape state trapped inside a fast block: if, for example, the second
filter in a pipeline peeks at more data than it pops, the first filter
is required to generate enough data to satisfy the peeks, resulting in
extra data sitting on the intermediate tape between iterations of the
fast filter.

It seems reasonable to assume that all of the data will be statically
allocated.  In this case, there are a couple of possibilities:

-- Literally everything is statically allocated.  The compiler inserts
   correct addresses and offsets into the generated code.  There are
   functions to move fast code state into canonical form, and
   canonical state into fast code form.

-- Many to all pieces are statically allocated, but the encode/decode
   functions return pointers to important bits.

The latter approach is actually more reasonable if blocks can be
reconfigured at runtime.  This might be something we want to do
eventually.  So let's go with that approach, which is somewhat similar
to what the notes have.  We probably want to rewrite the
canonicalization code so as to be useful, taking some other structures
with us as we go.

+-A-------------------------+
| +-B-----------+   +-E---+ |
| | +-C-+ +-D-+ |   |     | |
| | |   |>|   | |-->|     | |
| | +---+ +---+ |   |     | |
| +-------------+   +-----+ |
+---------------------------+

A has been running as fast code.  A message gets passed in, and the
runtime system decides to decompose A into B and E.  Assume for the
sake of complexity that both the C->D and B->E tapes have state that
needs to be saved.  (Bill says this isn't a problem, since the runtime
system will only consider (A) or (C->D->E) as possibilities.  Save
that thought.)  (But that means that the B box here is completely
irrelevant, since either (CDE) will be run as fast code within A or
(C->D->E) will be run as slow code.)

Here there are four tapes.  So the data structures look like:
A: in 1, out 4, children B, E
B: in 1, out 3, children C, D
C: in 1, out 2
D: in 2, out 3
E: in 3, out 4

There are three modes we can run in.  One is definitively the "slow
mode" and allows the scheduler to call filters as necessary to ensure
correct message semantics.  The other two are "fast modes" where some
state might be hidden.  It is possible to switch back and forth
between a given fast mode and the slow mode, but not between separate
fast modes.  It is also possible that higher-level modules will have
state that comes into play during message handling but that doesn't
directly affect data flow.

             1 +---+ 2 +---+ 3 +---+ 4    (As) (Bs)
Canonical:  -->| C |-->| D |-->| E |-->
               +---+   +---+   +---+
              
       1 +---+ 4              1 +---+ 3 +---+ 4   (As)
Fast: -->| A |-->      Fast: -->| B |-->| E |-->
         +---+                  +---+   +---+



Messaging
---------

Messages are sent through portals.  An arbitrary number of receiver
objects can be registered with a particular portal; a message sent
through the portal is sent to all of the receivers.  A portal has a
type associated with it, but this may be an interface type rather than
the type of any particular object.  An interface defines a set of
messages that may be passed through the portal.

Interface implementation works much like function calls in
object-oriented languages.  Each type provides a static
virtual-function table which it makes available.  The table associates
slots in an instance table with functions that should be called to
handle a method.

Both senders and receivers must register with the run-time system.
This allows the run-time system to obey the timing constraints on
messages.  Instances of objects do not have to perform any special
processing, aside from possibly initializing the virtual-function
table.  (This can probably just be static, though.)

void register_sender(portal p, void *sender, latency l1, latency l2);
void register_receiver(portal p, void *receiver,
                       void (**vtbl)(void *));

Example:
--------

Let's have a simple filter that amplifies its input by a constant,
changeable factor.

class AmplifyByN extends Filter
{
  int N;
  void init(int Nval)
  {
    input = new IntChannel();
    output = new IntChannel();
    N = Nval;
  }
  void work()
  {
    output.push(input.pop() * N);
  }
  void setN(int Nval)
  {
    N = Nval;
  }
}

For the sake of example, we might chain two of these together to get a
larger amplifier.

class AmplifyByMN extends Stream
{
  AmplifyByNPortal mPort = new AmplifyByNPortal();
  AmplifyByNPortal nPort = new AmplifyByNPortal();
  void init(int M, int N)
  {
    AmplifyByN m, n;
    add(m = new AmplifyByN(M));
    mPort.register(m);
    add(n = new AmplifyByN(N));
    nPort.register(n);
  }
  void setM(int Nval)
  {
    mPort.setN(Nval);
  }
  void setN(int Nval)
  {
    nPort.setN(Nval);
  }
  void setSquare(int Nval)
  {
    mPort.setN(Nval);
    nPort.setN(Nval);
  }
}

The compiler would generate fast code for both classes.  In the slow
system, the run-time library would call the work function for each of
the AmplifyByN filters separately.  However, the compiler would also
generate a work function for the AmplifyByMN filter which would do
all of the work itself (without calling on the AmplifyByN filter).

So.  Getting back to the original problem.  We want data structures
for AmplifyByN and AmplifyByMN.  These would look like:

+-MN----------+
| +-N-+ +-N-+ |
| |   |>|   | |
| +---+ +---+ |
+-------------+

struct AmplifyByN_data
{
  filter_context c;
  int N;
};

struct AmplifyByMN_data
{
  filter_context c;
  struct AmplifyByN_data child_1;
  struct AmplifyByN_data child_2;
};

(AmplifyByMN_data could, as a possibility, have a cached data member
for M*N, so the fast-path code only needs to do one multiply; we won't
do that for now.)

We also need to create interfaces for the message receivers.  Each of
the two classes has a separate set of functions:

#define MSG_AMPLIFYBYN_SETN 0
void (*AmplifyByN_vtbl[])(void *) = { AmplifyByN_setN };

#define MSG_AMPLIFYBYMN_SETM 0
#define MSG_AMPLIFYBYMN_SETN 1
#define MSG_AMPLIFYBYMN_SETSQUARE 2
void (*AmplifyByMN_vtbl[])(void *) = { AmplifyByMN_setM,
                                       AmplifyByMN_setN,
                                       AmplifyByMN_setSquare };

As a bottom-level filter, AmplifyByN is fairly straightforward.

void AmplifyByN_init(AmplifyByN_data *c, int N)
{
  set_stream_type(c, FILTER);
  set_pop(c, 1);
  set_peek(c, 0);
  set_push(c, 1);
  set_work(c, AmplifyByN_work);
  set_teardown(c, AmplifyByN_teardown);
  c->N = N;
}

void AmplifyByN_teardown(AmplifyByN_data *d)
{
}

void AmplifyByN_work(AmplifyByN_data *d, void *input, void *output)
{
  int *itape = input;
  int *otape = output;
  otape[0] = d->N * itape[0];
}

void AmplifyByN_setN(AmplifyByN_data *d, int N)
{
  c->N = N;
}

AmplifyByMN's code needs to be a superset of the AmplifyByN code; this
might be the simplest translation.

void AmplifyByMN_init(AmplifyByMN_data *d, int M, int N)
{
  set_stream_type(d, PIPELINE);
  set_pop(d, 1);
  set_peek(d, 0);
  set_push(d, 1);
  set_work(d, AmplifyByMN_work);
  set_teardown(d, AmplifyByMN_teardown);
  canon_info(d, AmplifyByMN_canon_info);
  encode_data(d, AmplifyByMN_to_canon);
  decode_data(d, AmplifyByMN_from_canon);
  register_children(d, 2, &d->child1, &d->child2);

  d->p1 = create_portal();
  AmplifyByN_init(&d->child1, M);
  register_receiver(d->p1, &d->child1, AmplifyByN_vtbl, LATENCY_BESTEFFORT);
  register_sender(d->p1, d, LATENCY_BESTEFFORT);

  d->p2 = create_portal();
  AmplifyByN_init(&d->child2, N, d->p2);
  register_receiver(d->p2, &d->child2, AmplifyByN_vtbl, LATENCY_BESTEFFORT);
  register_sender(d->p2, d, LATENCY_BESTEFFORT);
}

void AmplifyByMN_teardown(AmplifyByMN_data *d)
{
}

void AmplifyByMN_work(AmplifyByMN_data *d, void *input, void *output)
{
  int *itape = input;
  int *otape = output;
  int tape1[1];
  tape1[0] = itape[0] * d->child1.N;
  otape[0] = tape1[0] * d->child2.N;
}

void AmplifyByMN_canon_info(AmplifyByMN_data *d, sched_canon_state *s)
{
  s->child[0] = &d->child1;
  s->child[1] = &d->child2;
  s->tape[0] = &d->tape1;
  s->tapelen[0] = 1;
}

void AmplifyByMN_to_canon(AmplifyByMN_data *d)
{
  /* Nothing to do */
}

void AmplifyByMN_from_canon(AmplifyByMN_data *d)
{
  /* Nothing to do */
}

void AmplifyByMN_setM(AmplifyByMN_data *d, int M)
{
  send_message(d->p1, MSG_AMPLIFYBYN_SETN, M);
}

void AmplifyByMN_setN(AmplifyByMN_data *d, int N)
{
  send_message(d->p2, MSG_AMPLIFYBYN_SETN, N);
}

void AmplifyByMN_setSquare(AmplifyByMN_data *d, int N)
{
  send_message(d->p1, MSG_AMPLIFYBYN_SETN, N);
  send_message(d->p2, MSG_AMPLIFYBYN_SETN, N);
}

Having written this, it now seems reasonable to try to define what's
in sched_canon_state, the scheduler's idea of the canonical state.
This needs the set of child objects and tapes that are available; the
scheduler should take responsibility for draining tapes if necessary.

typedef struct
{
  void **child;
  void **tape;
  int *tapelen;
} sched_canon_state;

void canon_info(void(*info)(void *d, sched_canon_state *s));
void encode_data(void(*encoder)(void *d));
void decode_data(void(*decoder)(void *d));

canon_info() allows an init function to register a function to tell
the runtime system how to get at the canonical data.  child is an
array of pointers to child objects in some specified order, and tape
and tapelen are arrays of tapes and tape lengths, again in some
specified order.  encode_data() and decode_data() register functions
to populate/depopulate the canonical state information.  If we had an
AmplifyByNSquared filter, this might store the base value in response
to messages, and then set:

AmplifyByNSquared_to_canon(AmplifyByNSquared_data *d)
{
  d->child1.N = d->N;
  d->child2.N = d->N;
}

AmplifyByNSquared_from_canon(AmplifyByNSquared_data *d)
{
  d->N = d->child1.N;
}

As a side thought, tack on a structure that might be used by the
run-time scheduler to define a filter's context.

typedef struct
{
  int peeks;
  int pops;
  int pushes;
  work_fn work;
} filter_context;
