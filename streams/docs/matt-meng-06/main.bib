- exactly the same motivation for messaging
- describes general solution with Global State Table (GST), tagged by iteration number
- but compiler arranges schedule to deliver directly, so only overhead is checking for
  right iteration to deliver messages (like us)
- less formal description of schedule constraints
- calls extended graph "Synchronous Piggybacked Dataflow Graph (PDSF)"
- does handle:
  - MPEG-1 (layer 3) audio decoder
     - sends parameters such as sampling freq, global/local gain, scale factor, etc.
- does not handle:
  - upstream messages
  - adjustable latencies
  - cyclo-static delivery (introduces more complexity -- can't just 
    check periodic "offset" in receiver, need to check SDEP)

  sender so that two messages do not overlap while in transit (as that
  would lead to "state inconsistency")

  graph topology selected @ runtime.
   - vs. "type 2" configuration - two or more configurations at same time (?)
- PSDF: init graph, subinit graph, body graph
- claims benefits from specializing sub-graphs to parameters (e.g., scheduling optimizations)
   - done at compile time, switched at runtime
- evaluated in context of MPEG2 encoder, demonstrate smaller buffer size

  - consistent schedule problem (messaging)
  - iteration counts (dynamic rates)
  - saving buffers, reducing unnecessary delivery (messaging)
- deliver parameters to sub-graphs before starting to run
- implemented prototype in Ptolemy 2
- claims that PSDF cannot avoid buffer overhead of delivering control information
- implements MPEG2 *encoder* 3 ways for experiments:
  1. FSM/SDF combo
     FSM corresponds to dispatching to I-frame, P-frame, B-frame
  2. SDF - all frames go through everything with dummy values
  3. BLDF - reconfigures frame-processing per each frame
- claims that BLDF expression reduces number of connections and number
  of buffers in graph
