Streaming programs represent an increasingly important and widespread
class of applications that holds unprecedented opportunities for
high-impact compiler technology.  Unlike sequential programs with
obscured dependence information and complex communication patterns, a
stream program is naturally written as a set of concurrent filters
with regular steady-state communication.  The StreamIt language aims
to provide a natural, high-level syntax that improves programmer
productivity in the streaming domain.  At the same time, the language
imposes a hierarchical structure on the stream graph that enables
novel representations and optimizations within the StreamIt compiler.
We define the ``stream dependence function'', a fundamental
relationship between the input channels of two filters in a stream
graph.  We also describe a suite of stream optimizations, a
denotational semantics for validating theset optimizations, and a
novel phased scheduling algorithm for stream graphs.  {\bf RESULTS??}
