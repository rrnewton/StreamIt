\section{Conclusion}

We have presented a simple partitioning algorithm that uses dynamic
programming to exploit the regularities of a structured stream graph.
In the StreamIt compiler for Raw, we have implemented an effective
load balancing partitioner that uses the dynamic programming
algorithm; it shows performance improvements of 63\% over our previous
strategy.

We believe that dynamic programming could offer a simple and effective
solution to a number of problems in the streaming application domain.
In our future work, we are planning to use similar algorithms to
address problems of heterogeneous targets, code and data size
optimization, constrained scheduling, and hybrid space-time
multiplexing.
