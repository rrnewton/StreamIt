schedule. The $\sdepf{R}{S}$ function for filters $R$ and $S$ is given
in  Table \ref{tab:sdepconst}. The  blob between  filters $R$  and $S$
illustrates other possible stream elements. $R$ sends a message to $S$
with  latency $[1,2]$.  Executions  of  the blob  are  omitted, it  is
assumed  that at the  point $S$  executes, the  blob has  drained data
provided by $R$.}}

\caption{\small $sdepf{R}{S}$ function for example in Figure \ref{fig:sdepconst}. This particular $\sdep$ function was obtained by setting $push_R=2$, $pop_S=3$ and making the blob between $R$ and $S$ into a filter that pops 3 and pushes 4 every iteration of its work function. No initialization due to peeking is necessary in this example.}

In this section we decribe latency constrained scheduling, an 

The example  in Figure~\ref{fig:sdepconst} illustrates  the scheduling
of a single constraint: a  message sent upstream with latency $[1,2]$.
The resulting schedule consists  of two parts, an {\it initialization}
schedule and a  {\it steady state} schedule.  The  former is necessary
to ensure that during the actor's steady state execution, it may check
for messages  at proper boundaries.  For  the sake of  clarify, we use
$lastReceived$  to represent  the firing  of  $S$ that  sent the  last
message which has been  received by $R$; $n_S$ and  $n_R$ respectively indicate
the number of firings of $S$ and $R$.

In order  to compute  the initialization schedule,  $R$ is  allowed to
fire  $SDEP(minLatency)-1$ times,  while $S$  fires as  many  times as
possible.   This assures  that when  the steady  schedule  begins, all
firings  of  filters  will  contribute  to  new  message  sending  and
receiving,   thus  allowing   the  steady   state  schedule   to  fire
perpetually. In our example, the initialization schedule does not send
or receive any messages.

Once the  initialization schedule is  known, the steady state  schedule is
computed by  allowing the receiver $R$ to  fire continuously, provided
it  does not violate  the constraint  that a  message sent  during the
$lastReceived+1$ firing of $S$ must  reach $R$ according to the specified
latency;  this  is indicated  by  {\it  "Oldest  msg to  receive"}  in
Figure~\ref{fig:sdepcons}.  Now the  sender  $S$ is  executed as  many
times as possible, given the data provided via $R$. At this point, $R$
can receive the messages sent  by $S$ in  its executions
$[lastReceived+1  ... \min(n_S,$"{\it Newest msg to receive}"$)]$.
