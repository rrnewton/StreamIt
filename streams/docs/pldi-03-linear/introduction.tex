\section{Introduction}
Digital computation is becoming an increasingly ubiquitous element of
modern life.  Everything from cell phones to GPS systems to satellite
radios require increasingly sophisticated algorithms.  Optimization is
especially important for this domain, as embedded devices often have
high performance requirements and tight resource constraints.  Even
with the best available C compilers for DSP chips, programmers still
turn to assembly code to implement critical parts of embedded
applications.  This process is time-consuming, error-prone and
costly, and must be repeated for each generation of the target
architecture.  As algorithms and applications continue to grow in
complexity, these factors will become unmanageable.  There is a
pressing need for high-level DSP abstractions that a compiler can
consistently reduce to efficient low-level code.

In this paper, we demonstrate that a domain-specific stream language
can enable novel high-level DSP optimizations that would otherwise be
intractable in a general-purpose language.  Our source language is
StreamIt, which is specifically designed for high-performance signal
processing applications~\cite{streamit-asplos,streamitcc}; our
analysis focuses on filters that are {\it linear}.  StreamIt is
distinguished from a general purpose language in that it makes
explicit the large-scale parallelism and regular communication
patterns that are characteristic of streaming programs.  By analyzing
the primitive building block in StreamIt--the filter--our analysis can
detect large portions of the application that produce outputs as a
linear combination of the inputs; we can exploit this linearity
for a number of large-scale optimizations.  Though each filter is
programmed using imperative C-like code, the separation of filters
into autonomous units of the stream graph enables our analysis to be
far more effective and efficient than it could be on an equivalent
implementation in C alone.

This paper makes the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}

\item A linear dataflow analysis that can extract a linear transfer
function from the imperative code within a StreamIt filter.
\vspace{-6pt}

\item Combination rules for collapsing neighboring linear nodes into a
single linear representation.
\vspace{-6pt}

\item An automated procedure for translating a stream computation into
the frequency domain in order to optimize computationally intensive
linear nodes.
\vspace{-6pt}

\item An implementation of the above techniques in the StreamIt
compiler that automatically improves performance by a factor of
five on average and by a factor of $6.5$ in the best cast.

\end{itemize}

In the rest of this section, we give a motivating example and
background information on StreamIt.  Then we present our linear
representation (Section~\ref{sec:linearrep}) and our 
supporting dataflow analysis (Section~\ref{sec:dataflow}).  
Next we describe the
combination of linear filters (Section~\ref{sec:combine}) and the
translation to the frequency domain (Section~\ref{sec:freq}) before
giving results (Section~\ref{sec:results}), related work
(Section~\ref{sec:related}), and conclusions
(Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}).

To illustrate the program transformations that our technique is
designed to automate, consider a sequence of finite impulse response
(FIR) filters as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:motivating-example}. The
imperative C style code that implements this simple DSP application is
also shown. The program largely defies many standard compiler analysis
and optimization techniques because of its use of circular buffers and
the muddled relationship between {\tt data}, {\tt buffer} and the
output.

Figure~\ref{fig:example-streamit} shows the same filtering process
implemented in StreamIt. The StreamIt version is more abstract than
the C version.  It indicates the communication pattern between filters;
it shows the structure of the original block diagram; and it leaves
the complexities of buffer management and scheduling to the compiler.

Two optimized versions of the FIR program are shown in
Figures~\ref{fig:example-combine} and~\ref{fig:example-frequency}.  In
Figure~\ref{fig:example-combine}, the programmer has combined the {\tt
weights} arrays from the two filters into a single, equivalent array.
This reduces the number of multiply operations by a factor of two.  In
Figure~\ref{fig:example-frequency}, the programmer has done the
filtering in the frequency domain, using the FFT and IFFT to translate
between time and frequency.  Computationally intensive filters and
streams are more efficient when done in frequency instead of time.

Our linear analysis can automatically derive both of the
implementations in Figures~\ref{fig:example-combine}
and~\ref{fig:example-frequency}, starting with the code in
Figure~\ref{fig:example-streamit}.  These optimizations free the
programmer from the burden of combining and optimizing linear filters
by hand.  Instead, the programmer can design modular filters at the
natural granularity for the algorithm in question, relying on the
compiler to do the analysis and combination.

\subsection{StreamIt}

StreamIt is a language and compiler for high-performance signal
processing~\cite{gordon-thesis,streamit-asplos,streamitcc}.  In a
streaming application, each data item is in the system for only a
small amount of time, as opposed to scientific applications where the
data set is used extensively over the entire execution.  Also, stream
programs have abundant parallelism and regular communication patterns.
The StreamIt language aims to expose these properties to the compiler
while maintaining a high level of abstraction for the programmer.

StreamIt programs are composed of processing blocks called {\it
filters} which contain an input tape from which they can read values
and an output tape to which they can write. Each filter contains
a {\tt work} function which describes its atomic execution step in the
steady state.  The {\tt work} function contains C-like imperative
code, which can access filter state, call external routines and
produce and consume data.  The input and output channels are treated
as FIFO queues, which can be accessed with three primitive operations:
1) {\tt pop()}, which returns the first item on the input tape and
advances the tape by one item, 2) {\tt peek(i)}, which returns the
value at the $i$th position on the input tape, and 3) {\tt push(v)},
which pushes value {\tt v} onto the output tape.  Each filter
must declare the maximum element it will {\tt peek} at, the number of
elements it will {\tt pop}, and the number of elements that it will
{\tt push} during an execution of {\tt work}.  These rates must be
resolvable at compile time and constant from one invocation of {\tt
work} to the next.  
%Figure~\ref{fig:overview-filter} gives our notation these input/ouput rates.

A program in StreamIt consists of a hierarchical graph of {\tt
filters}.  Filters can be connected using one of three predefined
structures (see Figure~\ref{fig:structures}): 1) {\tt pipelines}
represent the serial computation of one filter after another, 2) {\tt
splitjoins} represent explicitly parallel computation, and 3) {\tt
feedbackloops} allow cycles to be introduced into the stream graph.
A {\it stream} is defined to be either a {\tt filter}, {\tt pipeline}, 
{\tt splitjoin} or {\tt feedbackloop}. Every subcomponents of a structure 
is a stream, and all streams have
exactly one input tape and exactly one output tape.

It has been our experience that most practical applications can be
represented using StreamIt's hierarchical structures.  Though
sometimes a program needs to be reorganized to fit into the structured
paradigm, there are benefits for both the programmer and the compiler
in having a structured language~\cite{streamitcc}.  In particular,
linear analysis relies heavily on the structure of StreamIt to express
stream transformations at a local and hierarchical level.
