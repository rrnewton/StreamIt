\section{The {\StreamIt} Language}
\label{sec:streamit}

{\StreamIt} is a portable programming language for high-performance
signal processing applications.  The current version of {\StreamIt}
is tailored for static-rate streams: it requires that the input
and output rates of each filter are known at compile time.  In
this section, we provide a very brief overview of
%the syntax and
semantics of {\StreamIt}.  A more detailed description of the design
and rationale for {\StreamIt} can be found in~\cite{thies02streamit} or
on our website~\cite{streamitweb}.

\subsection{Language Constructs}

The basic unit of computation in {\StreamIt} is the {\it filter}.  A
filter is a single-input, single-output block with a user-defined
procedure for translating input items to output items.
\begin{comment}
An example of a filter is the {\tt FIRFilter}, a component of our
software radio (see Figure \ref{fig:radiocode}). Each filter
contains an {\tt init} function that is called at initialization
time; in this case, the {\tt FIRFilter} calculates {\tt weights},
which represents its impulse response.
\end{comment}
Every {\filter} contains a {\work} function which describes the most
fine grained execution step of the {\filter}. Within the {\work}
function, the {\filter} can communicate with its neighbors via FIFO
queues, called {\Channels}, using the intuitive operations of {\tt
push(value)}, {\tt pop()}, and {\tt peek(index)}, where {\tt peek}
returns the value at position {\tt index} without dequeuing the
item.  The number of items that are pushed, popped, and
peeked\footnote{We define $peek$ as the total number of items
read, including the items popped.  Thus, we always have that $peek
\ge pop$.} on each invocation are declared with the {\work}
function, and are referred to as $u_f$, $o_f$ and $e_f$
respectively.

\begin{comment}
In addition to {\tt work}, a filter can contain a {\tt prework}
function that is executed exactly once between initialization and
the steady-state.  Like {\tt work}, {\tt prework} can access the
input and output tapes of the filter; however, the I/O rates of
{\tt work} and {\tt prework} can differ. In an {\tt FIRFilter}, a
{\tt prework} function is essential for correctly filtering the
beginning of the input stream.  The user never calls the {\tt
init}, {\tt prework}, and {\tt work} functions--they are all
called automatically.
\end{comment}

%% {\StreamIt}'s representation of a filter is an improvement over
%% general-purpose languages.  In a procedural language, the analog of a
%% filter is a block of statements in a complicated loop nest.  There is
%% no clear abstraction barrier between one filter and another, and
%% high-volume stream processing is muddled with global variables and
%% control flow. The loop nest must be re-arranged if the input or output
%% ratios of a filter changes, and scheduling optimizations further
%% inhibit the readability of the code.

%% In an object-oriented language, one could implement a stream
%% abstraction as a library.  This avoids some of the problems associated
%% with a procedural loop nest, but the programming model is complicated
%% by efficiency concerns--to optimize cache performance, the entire
%% application processes blocks of data that complicate and obscure the
%% underlying algorithm.

%% In contrast to these alternatives, {\StreamIt} places the filter in its
%% own independent unit, making explicit the parallelism and inter-filter
%% communication while hiding the grungy details of scheduling and
%% optimization from the programmer.

The basic construct for composing filters into a communicating
network is {\pipeline}.  A {\pipeline} behaves as the sequential
composition of all its child streams.  For example, the output of
{\tt DataSource} is implicitly connected to the input of {\tt
FIRFilter}, who's output is connected to {\tt FMDemodulator}, and
so on.

There are two other stream constructs besides pipeline: {\splitjoin}
and {\feedbackloop} (see Figure \ref{fig:structures}). From now on,
we use the word \stream to refer to any instance of a {\filter},
{\pipeline}, {\splitjoin}, or {\feedbackloop}.

A {\splitjoin} is used to specify independent parallel \streams that
diverge from a common {\splitter} and merge into a common
{\joiner}. A {\splitter} collects $o_s$ data from its {\Input}
{\Channel} and pushes $w_{s,i}, i \in \{0,\dots,n-1\}$ data to its
{\Output} {\Channels}. Similarly, a {\joiner} collects $w_{j,i}, i \in
\{0,\dots,n-1\}$ data from its {\Input} {\Channel} and pushes $u_j$
data to its {\Output} {\Channel}.

\begin{comment}
There are two kinds of {\splitters}: 1) {\duplicate}, which replicates
each data item and sends a copy to each parallel \stream, and 2)
{\roundrobin}$(w_0, \dots, w_{n-1})$, which sends the first $w_0$
items to the first \stream, the next $w_1$ items to the second
\stream, and so on.  {\roundrobin} is also the only type of {\joiner}
that we support; its function is analogous to a {\roundrobin}
{\splitter}.  If a {\roundrobin} is written without any weights, we
assume that all $w_i = 1$. The {\splitter} and {\joiner} type are
specified with the keywords {\tt split} and {\tt join},
respectively (see Figure \ref{fig:radiocode}); the parallel
streams are specified by successive calls to {\tt add}, with the
$i$'th call setting the $i$'th stream in the splitjoin.
\end{comment}

The last control construct provides a way to create cycles in the
stream graph: the {\feedbackloop}.  Due to space constraints, we
omit a detailed discussion of the {\feedbackloop}.

\subsection{Design Rationale}

{\StreamIt} differs from other \stream languages in that it imposes
a well-defined structure on the \streams; all \stream graphs are
built out of a hierarchical composition of {\filters}, {\pipelines},
{\splitjoins}, and {\feedbackloops}.  This is in contrast to other
environments, which generally regard a \stream as a flat and
arbitrary network of {\filters} that are connected by {\Channels}.
However, arbitrary graphs are very hard for the compiler to
analyze, and equally difficult for a programmer to describe.  The
comparison of {\StreamIt}'s structure with arbitrary \stream graphs
could be likened to the difference between structured control flow
and GOTO statements: though the programmer might have to re-design
some code to adhere to the structure, the gains in robustness,
readability, and compiler analysis are immense.

%% \subsection{Messages}

%% {\StreamIt} provides a dynamic messaging system for passing irregular,
%% low-volume control information between filters and streams.  Messages
%% are sent from within the body of a filter's {\tt work} function,
%% perhaps to change a parameter in another filter.  The central aspect
%% of the messaging system is a sophisticated timing mechanism that
%% allows filters to specify when a message will be received relative to
%% the flow of data items between the sender and the receiver.  With the
%% messaging system, {\StreamIt} is equipped to support full application
%% development--not just high-bandwidth data channels, but also events,
%% control, and re-initialization.
