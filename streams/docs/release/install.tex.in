This is for the October 17, 2003 release of the StreamIt compiler and
runtime system, version 2.0.\\

\section{Compilation}

Unpack the StreamIt source tar file somewhere; this can be in your
home directory, or in a shared directory.  Run \texttt{./configure} from
the top-level directory, which will look for several programs needed
to use the compiler and create files needed by the build process.  If
it complains that certain programs are missing, you should install
them before continuing; a list of programs required is included in the
\verb|README| file.

\subsection{Source Release}

For the source release, you need to add several directories to your
Java \verb|CLASSPATH|; these include the jar file for the ANTLR
LL($k$) parser generator, a tree for various third-party packages used
by the compiler, and the StreamIt compiler and runtime proper.  You
also need to add the top-level StreamIt directory to your
\verb|PATH|.  If you use bash, add to your \textsf{.bashrc} file:

\begin{verbatim}
### Location of unpacked StreamIt tree
STREAMIT_HOME=$HOME/streams

### Location of ANTLR jar file (test: 'java antlr.tool')
ANTLRJAR=/usr/share/java/antlr.jar

CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$ANTLRJAR
CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$STREAMIT_HOME/src
CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$STREAMIT_HOME/3rdparty
PATH=$PATH:$STREAMIT_HOME

export STREAMIT_HOME CLASSPATH PATH
\end{verbatim}
%$

\noindent or if you use tcsh, add to your \textsf{.cshrc} file

\begin{verbatim}
### Location of unpacked StreamIt tree
setenv STREAMIT_HOME ${HOME}/streams

### Location of ANTLR jar file (test: 'java antlr.tool')
setenv ANTLRJAR /usr/share/java/antlr.jar

setenv CLASSPATH ${CLASSPATH}:${ANTLRJAR}
setenv CLASSPATH ${CLASSPATH}:${STREAMIT_HOME}/src
setenv CLASSPATH ${CLASSPATH}:${STREAMIT_HOME}/3rdparty
setenv PATH ${PATH}:${STREAMIT_HOME}
\end{verbatim}
%$

Alternatively, the release comes with provided dotfiles that set up
all of the possible environment variables.  Note that the settings in
these files \textsl{must} be customized according to your local
infrastructure.  In this case, you can ``source''
\verb|$STREAMIT_HOME/include/dot-bashrc| or
\verb|${STREAMIT_HOME}/include/dot-cshrc|, as appropriate, after
editing the files.  If you want to override the settings the provided
scripts set (for example, the Raw StarSearch directory), set the
relevant variables after reading the \textsf{dot-bashrc} or
\textsf{dot-cshrc} file.

If you are trying to install both StreamIt and the Raw tools, set up
Raw first; the setup process requires that the \verb|TOPDIR| environment
variable be unset.  After running \texttt{make setup} in the starsearch
directory, edit the \textsf{dot-bashrc} and/or \textsf{dot-cshrc} files
to have the correct setting for \verb|TOPDIR|.

You need to reload your shell's dotfiles; an easy way to do this is to
log out and log in again.  You can compile the source tree: run
\texttt{./configure}, then \texttt{make}, from the top-level directory
of the StreamIt release.  After this completes, you should be able to
run the compiler.

\subsection{Binary release}

Add the StreamIt jar file to your Java \verb|CLASSPATH|, and the
top-level StreamIt directory to your \verb|PATH|.  If you use
bash, add to your \textsf{.bashrc} file

\begin{verbatim}
STREAMIT_HOME=$HOME/streams
PATH=$PATH:$STREAMIT_HOME
CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$STREAMIT_HOME/streamit.jar
\end{verbatim}
%$

\noindent or if you use tcsh, add to your \textsf{.cshrc} file

\begin{verbatim}
setenv STREAMIT_HOME ${HOME}/streams
setenv PATH ${PATH}:${STREAMIT_HOME}
setenv CLASSPATH ${CLASSPATH}:${STREAMIT_HOME}/streamit.jar
\end{verbatim}
%$

Compilation for the various backends requires extra setup.  If you are
compiling for Raw, you need to set up the Raw tools separately.  The
uniprocessor backend requires a runtime library, which can be compiled
by running \texttt{./configure} and then \texttt{make} from the
top-level directory of the StreamIt release.

After you complete these steps, you should be able to run the compiler.

\section{Testing the Compiler}

A simple test of the compiler is the ``hello world'' program, which
prints a series of increasing integers.  To run this test, type the
following:

\begin{verbatim}
cd /tmp
cp $STREAMIT_HOME/apps/examples/hello/HelloWorld6.str .
strc HelloWorld6.str
./a.out -i10
\end{verbatim}
%$

This should print the numbers 0 through 9, in order.

You can also test the Java library backend using \verb|strc|:

\begin{verbatim}
strc --library HelloWorld6.str -i10
\end{verbatim}

This will convert the StreamIt program to Java, compile it against the
Java library, and run it for ten steady-state iterations.
