  abstract =     "Clicks is a new software architecture for building
                 flexible and configurable routers. A Click router is
                 assembled from packet processing modules called {\em
                 elements}. Individual elements implement simple router
                 functions like packet classification, queuing,
                 scheduling, and interfacing with network devices. A
                 router configurable is a directed graph with elements
                 at the vertices; packets flow along the edges of the
                 graph. Several features make individual elements more
                 powerful and complex configurations easier to write,
                 including {\em pull connections}, which model packet
                 flow driven by transmitting hardware devices, and {\em
                 flow-based router context}, which helps an element
                 locate other interesting elements. Click configurations
                 are modular and easy to extend. A standards-compliant
                 Click IP router has 16 elements on its forwarding path;
                 some of its elements are also useful in Ethernet
                 switches and IP tunnelling configurations. Extending
                 the IP router to support dropping policies, fairness
                 among flows, or Differentiated Services simply requires
                 adding a couple of element at the right place. On
                 conventional PC hardware, the Click IP router achieves
                 a maximum loss-free forwarding rate of 333,000 64-byte
                 packets per second, demonstrating that Click's modular
                 and flexible architecture is compatible with good
                 performance.",
